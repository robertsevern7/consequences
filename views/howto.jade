        h3 What is a TalePipe?
        p A TalePipe is a short story that anyone can start and challenge friends to continue, piece by piece, until it's finished. Continuing the story is easy -- except for the fact that the person writing the next piece of the story can only see a few words of the previous part. Only when the finished story is revealed will your friends' creativity be proved.

        h3 How many people can collaborate on a tale?
        p Five friends, including the person who first created it.
